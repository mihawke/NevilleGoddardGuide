            “Your Mood Decides Your Future” (5/21/65)
          </h4>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            You catch the mood that you would have were you the man or the woman that you would like to be.
            And catching the mood,<strong> it’s done in the moment you catch the mood. </strong>
            So you will find the mood that you catch now externalized in the world into which you go.
            But you want it here? Alright, the chances are it will be here to convince you and prove to you the reality of scripture,
            which is “Whatever you desire, when you pray believe that you have received it, and you will.”
            If I have received it, could I suppress the mood that would accompany the receiving of it?
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            Are we not told, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving make all your requests known to God”? (Phil.4:6)
            The word prayer means “motion towards,” it means “accession to,” it means “nearness at,” “at or in the vicinity of.”
            So would I not go closer and closer and nearer to the wish fulfilled? As I come closer and closer to the wish fulfilled, am I not using my Imagination?
            So as I actually use my Imagination so it reaches the point of feeling of the wish fulfilled, then the thing is done.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            “Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless of course you fail to meet the test” (verse 5).
            Well, don’t fail to meet the test. Try it and see if you can’t find out who he is.
            And when you find him you’re going to find him to be yourself, your own wonderful creative power, your Imagination.
            You will discover that human Imagination is the divine body of the Savior of the world, the true vine of eternity, that’s who he is.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            God’s word is: When you know what you want, believe that you have it.
            Just believe that you have it so that you can arouse within yourself by that belief the necessary emotion.
            If you can arouse that emotion, well then, it’s done.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            “An idea that is only an idea produces nothing and does nothing. It must be felt.
            When it is felt, it invariably produces some motor state.”
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            So what would it be like if someone so loved me that they would say to me, “Goodnight, dear” and would they not kiss me? Well then, wait for that motor action. Wait in the feeling that you are wanted…wait for it and feel the touch, feel the contact.
            So if you actually feel it, would you not go to the very extreme and prove it?
            So bring the feeling that would be ours had we seen it objectively and then lose ourselves in that state, and see how it works.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            Do I say “thank you” in hope or do I not say “thank you” because the act is done? So always do it with thanksgiving.
            And so, if I do it with thanksgiving, I’ve completely accepted the reality of the mood that possesses me as the cause of what is to follow in this world.
            So if I do it in this way, what power in this world could stop me from bringing it to pass in my world? Nothing!

            “The Invisible God Behind The Made”
          </h4>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            We are told that “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” We find that motion was causative, that without motion it is impossible to bring forth anything, so God moved.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
            So when I sleep this night I must sleep as though I were in San Francisco, and as I’m falling off to sleep I must think of the place that I formerly knew which is Los Angeles and see it to the south of me 500 miles away, and fall asleep in that assumption that I actually am in San Francisco. That is a motion and without motion it is impossible to bring forth anything. This is true of everything in the world. In the beginning God created the inner and the outer, and then the Spirit of God moved, and then Creation began. So everything is within us…everything is within us.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
          I tell you that you can be anything you want to be in this world. But when you voice your request and you say verbally I want to be so and so, it must be a genuine desire and not something that you just flippantly say that I would like so and so. You must so want it that you’re going to remain faithful to that change in position relative to a fixed frame. If you want to be other than what you are, well then, you can’t just assume for one little moment that I am it and then go back to your former state. Let not the double-minded man think for one moment he’ll receive anything from the Lord as we’re told in the Book of James. Don’t for one moment think that I can be double minded and get anything from the Lord. 
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
          If you want to be known, I don’t care what the world will tell you, you may have not a thing in this world to show to the world that would cause anyone to look back at you and point you out as someone that is known. Forget that. You want to be known, you want to be rich, you want to be this, you want to be the other, well then, dare to assume that you are! For these assumptions, though at the moment you assume them, are denied by your senses, if you persist in them they will actually become externalized…they’ll become facts in your life.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
          If you really have a desire…but it must be a genuine desire so when you voice the wish it is not just an idle wish. It must be something that is so genuine that you mean it. Then I’ll tell you how to get it: you simply move from where you are mentally, not physically. People do all things on the outside. You don’t do it that way; you do it on the inside. What would the world look like if you were now the person that you want to be? What would it look like? Well, see it that way. If you see it that way, you have moved from where you were to where you would see it as you would see it if it were true. Well now, what would you see? Then move…the motion is all mental, all in your Imagination. But it must be genuine. If it’s genuine, you remain in that state. Don’t go from place to place, just remain there. “Into whatever house you go remain”
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
          So I ask you who are in business, who have…if you’re not in your own business and you want to transcend what you are, imagine that you have. Don’t ask yourself if you are qualified…you’ll be qualified. All that it takes you will get. All that it takes to fill the better job will come to you; the know-how will come to you. You simply assume that you are the man, the woman that you would like to be. Then in a way that no one knows it is going to take place. Your businesses will grow, your family will grow, and all these things will grow just as you have imagined it.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
          Do you really want…and you name it. You want a glorious home? Don’t say, “Well, I can’t afford it.” Do you really want it? Then sleep in it as you will conceive it. Do you want this, that or the other? Well then, sleep in it as though it were true…and that’s your motion. You move from where you were into where you want to be. But remain there! When you rise in the morning and the world tells you that you’re not there, you simply walk through the door just as though you were. You’re leaving that place. And in that state you remain and then everything happens. If it takes the entire world to aid it, the entire world will aid it.
          </p>
          <p className='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg text-white opacity-70 mb-5'>
          So take me at my word, it is impossible without motion to bring anything into this world, and the motion is all within you. The motion is a simple motion…all you do …you know exactly what you want. Well, if you had it, how would you see the world? If you see it as you now see it, you haven’t moved. If you see it as you would see it after the result, then you’ve moved. Now continue seeing that, for motion can be detected only by a change of position relative to another object. If I say I am moving now and I see everything as it is now, then I haven’t moved. But if as I move I look at the same frame of reference and I see it from a different angle, then I’ve moved. So I use as a frame of reference my friends, your face, and on your face I let you see me as you would have to see me if you knew of something that you do not now know. You have to see me differently. If you heard news of me that is not now known, when you meet me the next time you would see me differently. If that’s what I want you to know, then let me see on your face the expression that would imply that you know of that news. If you would be one who would congratulate me on that news, then let me accept the reality of your hand and the reality of your voice and the words coming congratulating me. Having done that, let me know that was true and let me have faith in this unseen reality. If I do, no power in the world can stop it, they can’t stop it. If man only knew this, he’d be free, really free. But today he doesn’t know the source of the cause of all the things that happen in this world. He doesn’t know causation, he doesn’t know the cause of phenomena, and he thinks the president is doing it or the army’s doing it or the Pentagon or something on the outside…his competitor is doing it. Not a thing is doing anything but what is taking place within him in his own wonderful human Imagination.
