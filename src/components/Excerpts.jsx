          If I dare to assume I am God, well then, my vision, my dream should reveal something fantastic…if I dare to assume it.
          If the world teaches you that you are a little worm—and that’s how the priesthoods of the world approach the
          congregations of the world, that you are sinful, you are this, you’re that and the other,
          everything but God-like—so they get you to assume that you are simply no good and that you’ve sinned.
          When you’ve sinned you don’t know and why you’ve sinned you don’t know, they can’t tell you that;
          but that you’re reaping the fruit or the results of some ancient being, who might have been an ancestor,
          and so you are now confined to this limited state.

          ‘I am Christ, I am God.’ Then I awoke to find myself in a pool of golden light, and then I reached, in a semi-trance state, for sheets of paper. I was still in that state, not knowing why I’m doing this, and I reached out and got two sheets of paper. On the first one I printed these words, ‘Feeling is the one and only reality.’ On the second sheet I wrote this, ‘Don’t think, feel’…and then he said, ‘Feel the reality of.’ ___?? The first one, “Feeling is the one and only reality” and the second, “Don’t think, feel; feel the reality of.”
