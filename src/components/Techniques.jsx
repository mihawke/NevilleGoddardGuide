          And so, this is what he did. He gave her the blessing that he wanted for her by doing this. Before retiring he said, “I am Christ, I am God,” and in the consciousness identifying himself with God, all things being contained within God, he could grant anything as God, and so he granted the blessing to this friend of his which anyone identified with God could do. And he felt completely relaxed in the fact that that act in itself was fact. He didn’t have to wait for confirmation of it; he didn’t have to wait for the physical effects to appear in this world; he knew at the very moment it was done. Therefore, he could sleep peacefully…and he fell asleep.

          So I want to actually move into this room and live in this room, alright, assume. Though everything denies it, and everyone in this world would oppose me taking possession of it, let me assume that I’m in it, and feel as I would feel were it true. If I could only persuade myself to catch that mood that would be mine were I in possession of what I want, and catch that mood just for the moment, like my friend, I don’t have to wait for confirmation. When the evidence appears in my world that mood was causative, and it will actually externalize itself in my world.

          So what would it be like if someone so loved me that they would say to me, “Goodnight, dear” and would they not kiss me? Well then, wait for that motor action. Wait in the feeling that you are wanted…wait for it and feel the touch, feel the contact.
          So if you actually feel it, would you not go to the very extreme and prove it?
          So bring the feeling that would be ours had we seen it objectively and then lose ourselves in that state, and see how it works.

            “The Invisible God Behind The Made”

          I want to be successful in business? I don’t care what the register told me today that I have and what I sold. I must sleep tonight as though it were all that I expected it to be, even though reason tells me it isn’t and my senses deny it. But I’ve got to actually assume that things are as I would like them to be, and then regardless of all the things round about me denying it, persist in that assumption. If I do it in this way, I cannot fail. This is the law by which we live in this world. So take it to heart.

          Now, how do I do it? I think of you who would actually congratulate me if you heard good news about me and I bring you into my mind’s eye and allow you to congratulate me.
           I know what this implies. The power is in the implication. What are you doing? You are congratulating me on my good fortune. 
          I accept that congratulations and I don’t duck it, I accept it as fact. 
          That is my subjective appropriation of my objective hope…because I am hoping that one day you will know of it and therefore you will congratulate me. 
          So I go ahead in time and I go into that state and I allow you to congratulate me now. 
          When you do it in the not distant future then it is only confirmation of my imaginal act. 
          But I will remember what I did, and having done it I will not forget what I did. Then I’ll go about my business. 
          When I think of you, I will let you know in my mind’s eye that you know of my good fortune. 
          The day must come, it must externalize itself. 
          So it externalizes itself, you will know of it, and you will congratulate me on my good fortune.
