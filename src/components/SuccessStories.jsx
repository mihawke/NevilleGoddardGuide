          I found that I did it and it worked. I don’t want to fall into that category spoken of in that first chapter of Romans that although he knew God he did not honor him as God. I found how it worked. I found that if I slept while in New York City as though I were in Barbados…and to prove I was in Barbados I thought of New York City and saw it 2,000 miles to the north of me. Then came a letter from my brother giving reasons justifying why I should come to Barbados, and then making it possible by enclosing a draft. In the letter he stated that if I would go to a certain steamship company that he had already written them and they would give me a ticket for Barbados; that I needed no money, the draft would take care of my normal needs aboard the ship and that I could sign for anything that I wanted.

          A friend of mine who is here tonight, and he’s promised to write it out for me, but here he said to me, “I started with $180 and I had so many debts that’s all that I had not so long ago in a small little restaurant in a small place, Ojai.” Now he’s contemplating an expansion into San Francisco. He said, “Tonight, Neville, the estimated value of my business is over a hundred thousand dollars.” I know him well. I first met him in San Francisco and he heard this. He was born and raised an ardent Catholic. In his mind’s eye he is still a deep, deep Christian, but he does not call it Catholicism or Protestantism or any other ism, but he was raised in the Catholic faith. He heard this from me in San Francisco and he believed it. He began to apply it and things worked. But we forget as he forgot, and then he remembered again, and then he forgot again. But now he has remembered and I hope this time that the memory is permanent.

So he started in this manner and everything fell into line. Yes, men came in to help, all these things happened, but they were not the cause. The cause of everything that happened to him was all in his own wonderful Imagination. He would turn to his wife and say, “What have we forgotten to do? We aren’t applying this principle.” So when things did not go as they should go, he remembered there was a law behind it all: things are not just happening and they’re happening only because he is creating them. Then he got back on the ball. Now here is this wonderful opportunity for expansion in the city of San Francisco, and it all just happened. Today, they’re all about to incorporate and the value is in excess of a hundred thousand dollars…and he started with $180. Now this is not too many years ago.

          So when you read that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep, you know who he is. He is your own Imagination, and it moves. You can stand perfectly still and move. And may I tell you, you can so move that you can be seen spatially at the point in space where you’ve imagined that you are. I’ve done it; I’m speaking from experience. Two thousand miles away I appeared to my sister, for I wanted her to see me, and yet physically I was in New York City in my own home. I wanted her to see me, and she came in and she saw me. She could not see what she ought to have seen with her physical eyes. She should have seen her son, but she couldn’t see her son, she could only see her brother Neville, for that’s what I wanted her to see when she looked at her son. Here I am physically in New York City, and yet to my sister in Barbados across water…and how did I move? I simply moved in my Imagination and yet in Barbados she saw me.

Then she sat down and wrote me and said, “Neville, the strangest thing has happened to me. I went into the room to look at Billy and I couldn’t see Billy, I only saw you. I rubbed my eyes, I did everything, and no matter how I looked I couldn’t see Billy. My son was not there, it was you. Will you please explain it to me if you can?” At that very moment I was doing what she said that she saw and witnessed. And when I came out I told my wife and told a friend who was waiting for me to come out of my bedroom exactly what I had done. Eight days later came a letter from my sister asking if I could throw some light on this strange thing that had happened to her. Had I told it eight days before, then they might have believed me afterwards, yes, but there would have been a question. But they could not deny that I told them eight days before what I had done. It came not by air, because in those days you couldn’t get a letter by air, so it came by boat. It took eight days to bring that letter.
